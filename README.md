# Profile-Standard

A data profile is an abstraction of raw data, in order to describe a certain object for example a person in certain segments like a Travel Profile. This profile does not contain any transactional or raw data, but aggregate information that can be helpful for merchants, as they for example tailor offerings or value. 

Data profiles contain data in various segments, such as personal data, professional data, consumption data etc. In addition to data, the profile also contains a license, which is a set of access permissions granted by the owner of the data profile with parameters such as recipient, duration and the license type. 

In order to make personal data profiles widely accepted, usable and universal, the format needs to follow an open standard and its principles. This project tracks the creation of the standard data profile format.

This project will be updated and expanded shortly.
